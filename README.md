An EA based on the RSI & Stochastic indicator. It is not profitable in the long run... at the moment. More tests and tweaks need to be done before it can be used on live account(s).

Timeframe: M5

Initially it was meant for GBP/USD, USD/CAD, and AUD/USD.

However, I tweaked the RSI settings for XAGUSD (Silver) yesterday, and it blew my mind. 

100% accuracy in the month of November and October 2020. 

$1000 -> $3994
100% win rate

I believe if we can modify the EA by adding some other indicators, and maintaining it accuracy, it is possible to double your account every month.

I am making this project public because I don't think I can completely tweak it on my own anytime soon. It will probably take some time before I perfect it.

Feel free to download the source code, modify it, and let me know if you found the perfect combination.

I have attached the relevant SET files as well. Pay attention to silver. Adjust the lot size manually for metals/CFDs because the MM module only work for currencies.
